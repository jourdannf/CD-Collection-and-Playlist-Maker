# Push Play: Physical Music Storage and Mixtape Helper
Push Play is a full-stack application that helps users who want to keep track of their physical msuci collection alongside generate their own mixtapes. A mixtape is a homemade compilation of music from different albums. This application allows users to add music from their collection into one "album" and the application will generate the albums required from their collection to complete the mixtape allowing for ease of at home creation.

Uniquely, this application also provides support for unique collections of music that may not come in CD (ie kpop albums and their unusual forms). In the future, it will also provide support for keeping track of the photocards in your collection alongside different album versions and will provide recommendations to users based on their music taste. It will also provide support for furthering your physical music collection by showing users where they can get the next album on their list.

Additionally, support for songs outside of the users' collection but inside of their wishlist as a part of their mixtapes is also being considered.
